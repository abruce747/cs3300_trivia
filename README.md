# cs3300_trivia
All work is done in Iteration_01 and the latest working version lives there.
As much as I'd like to merge the branch back into main, I can't seem to do it correctly or find the right guide for now. 
I've accidentally messed up my local files. I have previously accidentally overwritten my work and I'd rather not risk another deletion.
