Notes for next steps==========================================================================
 1. Update the cards to refer to images. Make the images about Community for now, but give the users 
     their own spaces eventually. Also add answer options as a list of items (4 for now)

 2. Update views and urls and templates to put the cards inside the same page as the carddeck page.
 3. Have carddecks appear as <a href> list links on the homepage (index). 
 4. Have the carddecks appear as list items (a hrefs) on the user page.
 5. Change the Card model to make the number something not decided by the user
